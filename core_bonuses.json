    "description": "ASGARD Mechs are powered with Thermal Engines, a proprietary technology of the company. By removing all safety restrictions on the engine, one can allow it to enter a slow meltdown that will eventually result in the mech's destruction, but potentially buy the pilot just enough to survive the final hour of a battle by forcing the engine to keep running regardless of how damaged the mech becomes.",
    "effect": "During a short rest, you may choose to activate your Mech's <i>Final Hour.</i> Once you choose to do this, this effect cannot be ended except during a Full Repair.<br>During your <i>Final Hour</i>:<ul><li>You are considered to be in the Danger Zone at all times, regardless of your current Heat.</li><li>Reduce your Mech's Structure to 1. For each Structure lost this way, regain 1 Stress (minimum of 1). This can exceed your Mech's Stress cap.</li><li>Any time you would take damage, you take the same amount of Heat instead. This Heat gain cannot be reduced by any means, and the amount of Heat gained is determined before damage reduction, like Armor or Resistance.</li><li>You cannot clear Heat except through Overheating.</li><li>Whenever you would make a Overheat roll, you always roll 1 die, regardless of how much Stress you are missing.</li></ul>"

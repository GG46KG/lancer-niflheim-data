If you are not entitled to this information, do not continue or you may be in violation of trade law.</i><br/><br/>Metavault Research Result - Stabilized Prototype 004 <i>'GREENHORN'</i><br/><br/>I think that this prototype all but proves that the contents of the Metavaults aren't completely random, as was the popular theory, but in fact may connect to entirely different stable realities. What we are shown may seem to be effectively nonsense, but it's in fact several parallel independent realities (<i>\"Variants\"</i>) blending together rapidly. What the existence of these variants actually implies is up to interpretation, however. My peers have a number of theories ranging from the existence of a 'multiverse' to the idea of that our emotions generate these potential timelines dynamically. I believe that it's even more complex, based on my experiences during the Siege of Niflheim: there seem to be meta-beings on a different level than us that control not only our actions but the very nature of our existence simply through their imagination, and these realities are simply their fantasies. Regardless of the cause of these variants, using the same technology that was used by NULL and BAYHOUND to stabilize the connection to Terminus in the Eljuthnir drilling station, we can force the Metavault to temporarily stabilize, allowing us to peek into one variant for a short time. We copied the structure of the Greenhorn from the frozen Metavault and despite all expectations, I can confirm: it's a living plant with no technological components whatsoever. It's made of normal wood. This may very well be <i>literal magic</i> from a variant where that isn't a ridiculous thing to say.",

He was taken in at a young age by the venerable scrapper \"Junk Dog\" Joe, founder of the Junkyard Dogs, alongside another young man, \"Killer Dog\" X, who alongside the rest of the scrapper crew, offered him more than enough family for his entire youth. Intent to not be upstaged by his more level-headed adoptive older brother, Rikishi developed a mech that was a brash and loud as him. Never one to rest on his laurels, Rikishi still continually tweaks his self-made Sonic Burst Driver, ever aspiring to reach a legendary status that would secure both his name and the Junkyard Dogs' in history.",

Markus too had experienced the horrors of corporate war, of massacres committed by criminal gangs, and of deaths brought about by the sheer hostility of the Outer Arm Frontier Sector.

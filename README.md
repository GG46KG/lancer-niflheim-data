## Patch Notes

### Version 1.4 (April 24th, 2023)
- Clarified some situations on a number of systems, Frame traits and abilities. 
- Fixed some typos.
- Frames Adjusted:
  - Nidhogg (ASG): The Roots of Yggdrasil are now Reliable 1 in all profiles.
  - Draugr (ASG): Unstable Targeting System no longer penalizes thrown weapons. Bonus damage granted by GIVE IN reduced. Pilot damage from GIVE IN increased to 3 from 1d3. Clarified the intention of Walking Dead to prevent overflow damage.
  - Virtuoso (Lumico): Third Act's Act die is reduced once per round, guaranteed, instead of having a chance to be reduced once per turn.
  - Philosopher (Lumico): REQUEST: REPEAT SEQUENCE no longer consumes uses of Limited systems. REQUEST: REPEAT SEQUENCE can now be used during Forge of Hours without penalty.
  - Trailblazer (Lumico): Bloody Flux now generates Heat instead of dealing damage. Increased Heat and Repair cap by 1 each.
  - Slowpoke (IND): Adjusted Big Iron's target destruction effect.
  - Bayhound (IND): Houndhunt now specifically uses the HOWL profile. HOWL is now Burst 2 instead of Burst 3.
- Mods Reworked:
  - Perfectionist Mod (Virtuoso 3)
- Systems Reworked:
  - NOVA Fragment: PREDICT (Philosopher 1)
- Systems Adjusted:
  - BDM (Nidhogg 3): Ballistic Launch now requires a round to become available, and the missile lands at the end of the target's turn.
  - VALKYRIE-Class NHP (Nidhogg 3): Bonus crit damage is now applied to all affected weapons.
  - Beasthunter Tactical Knife (Fenrir 1): No longer AP. Can make a second attack against all biological targets, not just larger ones.
  - Reverse Beartrap (Fenrir 2): Now explodes after a single round instead of three.
  - XS-Series Drone Parts (Jormungandr 2): Increased the damage of the XS Thermal Micromissles reaction from 2 Explosive to 3.
  - Full Spectrum Hunt/Kill System (Jormungandr 3): Increased the drone's range to 3.
  - Martial Doctrine I/II/III (Draugr 1/2/3): Combo actions no longer cause the user to gain Heat. Reduced the Heat cost of Martial Doctrine III.
  - Choreograph System (Virtuoso 1): Adjusted the duration of the effects to make them easier to activate. (Tango lasts until used, Waltz lasts until the end of _your_ next turn.)
  - NOVA Fragment: RECORD (Philosopher 2): Can now target Biological characters.
  - NOVA Fragment: WISH (Philosopher 3): Now explicitly states that the GM is responsible for ruling on how systems activated by this system should work and provides some guidance.
  - Lamplight Chemical Charges (Trailblazer 1): Increased from Limited 3 to 4.
- Weapons Removed: 
  - TEAM Gun (Nidhogg 1)

  - ASG-N10 Novic-Lovelace Nanite Weapon (Nidhogg 1)
  - Orchid (Exotic)
- Weapons Adjusted:
  - Hymir Flexible Grenade Launcher (Jormungandr 2): Renamed from Nastrond Flexible Grenade Launcher to differentiate it from the Nidhogg's cover trait.
  - Prototype No. 161 (Draugr 3): Now requires the user to deal damage while Bloodstoked, instead of simply attacking.
  - Heartseeker (Virtuoso 1): Can no longer deal bonus damage.
  - "Stern Teacher" Smoothbore Gun (Trailblazer 2): Damage increased from 1d6+5 to 1d6+8

### Version 1.3.1 (March 6th, 2023)

- Updated the Nidhogg's type to ARTILLERY/SUPPORT
- Adjusted the Philosopher's REQUEST: REPEAT SEQUENCE action to be functional on a much larger number of actions (e.g. single attacks from a Barrage).

  - Asgard Lockdown System (Nidhogg 1)
  - VALKYRIE-Class NHP (Nidhogg 3) (Formerly ULLR-Class NHP)

- Updated the flavor text on the Fenrir.
- Clarified the effect of some of the Jormungandr's actions.

- Added the ASG Draugr frame, for better or worse.
- Frames Adjusted:
  - Trailblazer (Lumico): Manifest Destiny now allows for much more movement.
  - Fenrir (ASG): Removed the Intimidate trait. Dramatically buffed the Fenriswolf Integrated NHP trait, but removed its SP refund. The TYR Battlesuit now has resistance to AoE attacks, but now suffers the effects of any Tech Actions affecting the Fenrir. Beasts of Slaughter no longer grants the TYR Battlesuit Resistance to all damage, but does instantly recharge ASG-Berserk Stimulant Injection. The TYR Battlesuit's HP now scales with Grit instead of the Fenrir's HP. The Wolfstooth now explicitly benefits from Talents, and is considered an Auxiliary weapon.

  - Martial Doctrine I   (Draugr 1)
  - Martial Doctrine II  (Draugr 2)
  - Martial Doctrine III (Draugr 3)
- Added new weapons:
